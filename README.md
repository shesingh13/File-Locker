# DESCRIPTION

## Project objective: 

 File Locker is digitize product with features like: 

1. Retrieving the file names in an ascending order 
2. Business-level operations: 

    a. Option to add a user specified file to the application.

    b. Option to delete a user specified file from the application.

    c. Option to search a user specified file from the application.

    d. Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main 
context.

3. Option to close the application: Application uses exception, merge sorting algorithm and data structure searching techniques are used. 
 



### The flow and features of the application:

 * Display the welcome screen. It should display:

    * Application name and the developer details 

    * The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information

 * Display the result upon successful operation

 * Display the result upon unsuccessful operation

 * Option to navigate back to the main context

 * There should be a third option to close the application

 * Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance
